lightweight interactive brokers gateway docker

It's just pure `IB Gateway` and don't include any VNC service (for security reason, I don't like expose extra port)

This docker image just installed:

```bash
docker pull manhinhang/ib-gateway-docker
```

```bash
docker build -t ib-gateway-docker .
docker run -d ib-gateway-docker tail -f /dev/null
```

### Create a container from the image and run it

```

This example will using [ib_insync](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync) to demonstrate how to connect `IB Gateway`
