# Example for google cloud secret manager

If you considing choose Google cloud as your IB gateway host, Google recommanded store your sensitive key in secret manager.

Reference: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var#managing_secrets

> Environment variables can be used for function configuration, but are not recommended as a way to store secrets such as database credentials or API keys. These more sensitive values should be stored outside both your source code and outside environment variables. Some execution environments or the use of some frameworks can result in the contents of environment variables being sent to logs, and storing sensitive credentials in YAML files, deployment scripts or under source control is not recommended.
>
> For storing secrets, we recommend that you review the best practices for secret management. Note that there is no Cloud Functions-specific integration with Cloud KMS.
